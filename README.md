# OneDriveUploaderPSv3

This is a data exfiltration script based on the idea that an employee uploading to the cloud during business hours will not be a cause for
alarm.  Relying on Powershell, this script allows you to "live off the land" and not introduce programs that could trip Antivirus.  

This script was written during the summer of 2017 and was used during a live Red Team engagement (it's combat proven). It is only uploaded
now for archive purposes.   

This script is written for Powershell v3.
